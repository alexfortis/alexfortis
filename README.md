Hi, I'm Alex Strong, a graduate student at Binghamton University (SUNY), on schedule to complete my MS in Computer Science in spring 2022.

I'm doing research under Yu David Liu, adding features to the Paparazzi UAV programming language to enforce FAA regulations at compile time.

You can reach me at [astrong3@binghamton.edu](mailto:astrong3+github@binghamton.edu).
